Classes flagged as private are visible outside the module where they are declared or how can we manage the scope of the items exported by a library ?

For example, we have a class c1. Internally, it uses object of classes c2 and c3. Those classes have no purpose outside the context of c1.

I tried to add c1, c2 and c3, mark c1 as Global then c2 and c3 as private.

The problem is that c2 and c3 are still visible in autocomplete and the compiler ignores the scope, until it discover the class is private (detailed example below)

Source code
Project: https://github.com/slo1958/sl-xj-lib-loging.git
Branch: Testing-Project-library-with-Xojo2025r3  

The folder contains:
- subfolder _ScopeTest, the project with the code for the example below
- subfolder lib-building-project: the project used to create the library
- subfolder test-project: a project using the library

Open the project in test-project
Navigate to the handler of the open event of the only window
Read comments and follow instruction

Detailed description
The code is in the subfolder _ScopeTest
A problem with libraries is coming from the handling of scope of items in a module. The problem is not related to libraries but makes using libraries more difficult.

Let's say I create a module, named ScopeTest with two classes: clGlobal (with scope = global) and clPrivate (with scope = private)

Somewhere, outside the module, for example in the open event handler of the unique window:

1/ I add 'var k1 as new ScopeTest.clPrivate'

The compiler return an error 'This type is private and can only be used within its module'

2/ Then, I add 'var k2 as new clPrivate'
I get the error 
	'Can't find a type with this name. Did you mean class ScopeTest.clPrivate?'

This should not happen.

3/ If in a method, I start to type 'ScopeTest.cl', I'm getting a list with both clPrivate and clGlobal.


4/ To the class clGlobal, I add two methods:
mPublic() with scope set to public
mPrivate() with scope set to priavte

Then I add
var k4 as new ScopeTest.cLGlobal

when I type 'k4.', autocomplete only offers mPublic()


Expected behaviour
1/ Ok, similar to what we have if I reference a private method in an object

2/ Should get that message if the referenced item is accessible

3/ Should not get items declared as private

4/ Expected behaviour
